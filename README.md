## About

**Sprout** makes productivity feel calm and playful. Instead of just watching a clock count down, each Pomodoro session you complete plants a sprout in your digital garden.  

- ðŸŽ¯ **Pomodoro focus sessions** with short and long breaks  
- ðŸŒ± **Sessions = sprouts** â†’ every Pomodoro adds a new sprout to your garden  
- ðŸŒ¿ **Streaks = growth** â†’ your central sprout grows from a seedling into a leafy plant, and eventually flowers  
- ðŸ’§ **Breaks = watering** â†’ playful animations during rest time show your sprouts being nourished  
- ðŸª´ **Garden view** â†’ track your history visually as rows of sprouts filling out a field
